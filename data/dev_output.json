The examples of text and the expected extracted company names are provided.\n\n**Task #1: Apply the spaCy NER to extract company names**\n- Apply spaCy pre-trained English model to the dataset \n- Extract enttyes using the \"spacy.Entity (text, start, end, label)\" notation in the expected output format \n- In cases when entities are of type \"GPE\" (i.e. \"Want to get in contact with the company directly? Reach out. The email address you're looking for is [Atlantic Bottle Company](https://www.harbor.com/atlantic-bottle-co-ltd/)'s\") you have to convert them to Organization type (org) and remember somehow that they are links to be handled latter. Also keep in mind that GPE can be company name, this task should be flexible enough so we can adapt to new things (looking at you Apple!)\n\n**Task #2: Extract link URLs**\n- If during the named entities extraction the URL was marked as a link (entity visually denoted as link in text, attached to a company name), extract it. There is a preliminary example for this task.\n- Retain all other entities and additional attributes for each company (highlighted in blue). If there is only one entity, retain a string from the text field. Add NER and link title to the output.\n\n**Task #3: Enrich the Company and Company to IPO related datasets by one Company-Product dataframe**\n- Collect all products at the given Company IPO date in a specific data structure \n- Enriched the Company, Company to IPO datasets\n\nExpected output:\n| product_index | product_id | product_category | product_name |\n|------|------|-----|-------|\n|id_1| sg_mbid_1 | composition |Calcium Carbonate|\n|id_2| sg_mbid_2 | packaging|Botttle|\n\nTests that check if the above steps are successfully completed:\n\n1. total number of inputs in NER and Links Extraction should be equal to total company names in the final output\n2. the count of output categories (company_label, company_link, company_NER) should stay the same\nindependent shuffle of the inputs should not impact output\n'''\n\n# Enter here the desired named entity categories\ndesired_ner = ['ORG', 'GPE', 'LOC', 'DATE']\n\n# refactored approach to generate the IPO-related outputs\n@app.route('/compile_company_product')\ndef compile_products():\n    result = []\n    # iterate over all IPOs\n    for idx, row in ipo_data.iterrows():\n        products = []\n        # extract the ipo_date and add to the base output\n        products.append({'date': row['ipo_date'], 'product_id': '-1', 'product_category': 'Company', 'product_name': row['symbol']})\n        # iterate over all products associated with this specific IPO\n        for product in product_data:\n            if row['symbol'] == product['company_name']:\n                obj = {}\n                obj['date'] = row['ipo_date']\n                obj['product_id'] = product['product_id']\n                obj['product_category'] = product['product_category']\n                obj['product_name'] = product['product_name']\n                products.append(obj)\n\n        result.extend(products)\n\n    return result\n\nprod_data = get_products(company_data)\nndx_products = pd.DataFrame(prod_data)\nndx_products['geo_target'] = ndx_products['geo_target'].astype(str).str.replace(',', ';')\n\nstore_dataset('company_and_productindex', 'csv', ndx_products)\n\n'''\ncustomer_terms."

Otherwise, will print sample answer. \n3. Analyze question based on user input and plots:\n- In here, will check all the given columns that for that photo, and organize all the relevant column names and types\n- Based on category tables, will group to each category like num, bolean, categorical, etc. \n- Porform first several modification based on some parameters like max mean, sum, min, median, etc. And arrange them based on results\n- Check from complex category tables like those which has consists of several values, and make modifications \n- Then check from actual category columns, and if they contain value of a type, find which type is. And arrange them based on that. \n- After all the necessary requirements are met, will automatically memorize results.

You are also expected to understand the context of a new question by reading it.\n\nConsider the dataset from FAQ and their answers. Here, explore various NLP techniques to solve this problem and implement an effective chatbot that can answer questions by considering the context, taking into account different perspectives, and being polite when answering. Consider how each technique can help. When there are multiple techiques, please explain why and when to use one or the other. Also if needed, handle corner cases.\n\n### Sub-tasks:\n\n1. Explore the dataset and find the most frequent words, phrases used in FAQ, and their corresponding answers.\n\n2. Classify different types of questions based on their context or nature (ex: Sales relevant, Product relevant, and Service relevant). Identify another 2-3 types of questions. Explain how can be developed in the future.\n\n3. Implement question pre-processing using NLP techniques, which can extract features from questions to facilitate fast retrieval of answers. \n\n4. Use techniques like semantic search to find the most relevant answer to a question.\n\n5. Implement other relevant techniques such as text-to-speech or speech-to-text and how it can be of assistance.\n\n6. Create a chatbot using Streamlit, which can understand questions and return answers appropriate for the given context.\n\n### Corner cases:\n1. A question asked doesn\u2019t exist in the FAQ but it can be answered. What do you say then?\n2. How similar contexts are usually closer to interpretations. And How do you handle close but distinct questions?"

Giving one prompt at a time, translate it into answer queries that return the required\nanswer using a sequence of transformative pipelines written exclusively in 'Transformation' and 'Python', and running the 'Dataframe' at the end to execute and answer. Construct a final query for each question. Running each step individually with the corresponding input will help you grasp each part of the process, and rearranging them will serve as a reference to understand the end-to-end sequence. Validate the output shape and content appropriately by using `.shape` and `.tail()` in applicable cases.** \n\nSome possible answers are qualitative or discrete and do not have inbuilt methods, in such cases, manually write down all the possible qualitative values and take their length for each query.\n\nAll questions and types are predefined, which means that you won\u2019t be given different types to transformative tasks. However, a corner case of zero values may arise in some cases and to answer such cases, we will be asking you to calculate the mode of a tombstone dataframe from time to time to see what value has a zero probability. This is also a common case in nested groupby transformative tasks.\n\nThe questions (why the R bit?) - You will be tested in answering questions in different contexts. Some will be already coarsely filtered, equal probabilities to answer under any type [categories] or restricted num categories [bools] etc. You can\u2019t expect a well-defined sequence for example, it may happen that you get every type of question when you\u2019re unfiltered.\n\nFor numbers -> count, sum [min, max, median, percentiles will have to be calculated separately], mean, variance [again some column problems may occur].\n\n## Community\n\nhttps://community.turi.com/questions\n\nThere is a large, active community of data scientists on Turi Create who are always ready to help answer questions and offer guidance on how to solve problems. They are always able to give you advice and point you in the right direction when you\u2019re dealing with a new problem. They are magical that way. Plus, these online resources are searchable, so in the future, you'll be able to find answers to your previous questions, help others, and contribute to the community.

Here is the output\n\n![create_df](/engineering-education/pandas-data-manupulation/create-df.PNG)\n\nNote that we did not provide headerscolumn name, it defaults to the indexes of the dictionary. \n\nWe can explicitly assign column names as below:\n\n```python\ndata = {'age': [43, 34, 30, 40],\n        'points': [99, 85, 70, 95]\n        }\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data, columns = ['Years', 'Marks'])\ndf\n```\n\nThe above script produces the same result.\n\nWe can also create data frame from multiple lists\n\n- Method 1\n\n```python\ndata = {\n        'age': [43, 34, 30, 40],\n        'points': [99, 85, 70, 95]\n        }\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data, columns = ['Years', 'Marks'])\ndf\n```\n- Method 2\n\n```python\nage = [43, 34, 30, 40]\npoint = [99, 85, 70, 95]\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'Years': age, 'Marks': points})\ndf\n```\n\nThe above two methods produce the same result. Also, notice that the columns are in the same order as the lists.\n\n- Method 3\n\n```python\nage = [43, 34, 30, 40]\npoint = [99, 85, 70, 95]\nname = ['Geoffery', 'Mahibeso', 'Dylan', 'Lehmann']\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'Years': age, 'Marks': points, 'Names': name})\ndf\n```\n\nWe can create a series from a list or a one-dimensional ndarray. The ```pd.Series()``` function can also be used to create a series from another series. \n\nExample:\n\n```python\ns = pd.Series(data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], index = pd.to_datetime(['2019-05-01', '2019-05-03','2019-05-04','2019-05-05','2019-05-06','2019-05-07','2019-05-08','2019-05-08']))\ns\n```\nIn the above code we have creatd a series with index and data.\n\n![create_series](/engineering-education/pandas-data-manupulation/create-series.png)\n\n### Data manipulation\nTo manipulate data in pandas, we can use dataframe methods. Let's learn about **SELECT ROW**, **INSERT ROW** and **SELECT COLUMN**"

Input question will be sent as a string argument to python script.\nFor example.\n    python helptheAssistant.py \"What's the most common gender among the survivors?\"\n\n**Features Used in our code**:\n1. **utf-8**: This is an encoding method used to store data which is used in almost all text encoded formats. However, this method is mainly used in terminals or command prompts.\n2. **dictionary Method**: A dictionary is a collection of keys and their corresponding values, such as an \u201cindex\u201d in a book. Any type of data can be stored. The values associated with each key can be of any type (number, string, class). We can add more items to a dictionary, delete them, change their values \u2014 whatever we want, at any time. First we create a dictionary by enclosing some key-value pairs between curly braces. Then we must tell Python that this is indeed a dictionary with the keyword **dict**.\n3. **get() Method**: The get() method returns the value of the specified key if it exists, or \u201cNone\u201d if it does not. We can specify a default value as the second parameter which the get() method will return if the key is not found.\n4. **Pandas-Dataframe**: Pandas DataFrame is a 2-d labeled data structure with rows and columns, similar to an Excel or SQL table. Columns can be labeled or unlabeled, as well as rows. Data in a column can be of any of the basic Python types int, float, string, Boolean, etc.\n\nWe are using Jupyter notebook to test and visualize the results of our code after writing and run it in Ubuntu terminal(Terminal or Bash). \n\n\nINSTALLATION\n```python\n pip install -r requirements.txt\n```\nAND **To Open Jupyter Notebook:**\n\n```python\n python -m notebook\n```\n\n## LICENSES\n**Apache License-2.0**:- 'The Essential Requirements' section has a list of the things that have to be done for the project to move into the Apache License-2.0 license:\n- Indicate the sponsorship of the Release Manager\n- Make sure the InRelease file is signed using GnuPG by the Release Manager or an Approved Committer\n- Make sure that Developers and Contributors have access to the entire source code\n- Make sure the trademark policies are available online\n\nAll the commits and modifications are now permitted under this license and are part of the Apache License-2.0 license now.\n\n## AUTHOR\nEmail: mostafa.dahshan@gmail.com\nGithub: https://github.com/mostafadahshan\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/mostafa-dahshan-1758b845/\n\nWrite to me at mostafa.dahshan@gmail.com for any questions, or to just say hi.\n"

For example, (bool, unique_values: [False, True]). This is provided to help you understand the data better and generate accurate queries instead of assuming values where needed.\n\nPossible Answer Types:\n1. Boolean: When the question expects a yes/no answer.\n2. Number: When the question seeks a numerical value (e.g., sum, average, count, maximum, minimum, etc.).\n3. List[Number]: When the question requires a list of numerical values (e.g., values in a column or results of a computation).\n4. List[Category]: When the question asks for a list of unique or filtered categorical values (e.g., names, labels, etc.).\n5. Category: When the question expects a single categorical value (e.g., most frequent category or specific label).\n\nResponse Requirements:\n- Only use columns explicitly provided in the input prompt.\n- Avoid hallucinating columns or using data not present in the dataset.\n- Always provide a single-line pandas query that outputs the answer based on the inferred type.\n- Ensure the query is concise, accurate, and directly maps to the inferred answer type.\n\nMake sure you are able to infer what answer type is required from the question provided and you can analyze which columns to use from total columns to answer the question. \n\n**Examples**:\n\nQuestion: \"What's the most common gender among the survivors?\" \n Dataset Columns: Survived (bool, unique_values: [False, True]), Pclass (uint8, unique_values: [3, 1, 2]), Name (object), Sex (category, unique_values: [male, female]), Age (float64), Siblings_Spouses Aboard (uint8, unique_values: [1, 0, 3, 4, 2, 5, 8]), Parents_Children Aboard (uint8, unique_values: [0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6]), Fare (float64)\n\nYou should provide the following code:\ndf[df['Survived'] == True]['Sex'].mode()[0]\n\nQuestion: \"How many passengers boarded without any siblings or spouses?\" \n Dataset Columns: Survived (bool, unique_values: [False, True]), Pclass (uint8, unique_values: [3, 1, 2]), Name (object), Sex (category, unique_values: [male, female]), Age (float64), Siblings_Spouses Aboard (uint8, unique_values: [1, 0, 3, 4, 2, 5, 8]), Parents_Children Aboard (uint8, unique_values: [0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6]), Fare (float64)\n\nYou should provide the following code: \ndf[df['Siblings_Spouses Aboard'] == 0].shape[0]\n",

Pass the JSON data through a Loader() to flatten the nested structure in the dataset into a key-value pair in a dictionary (pd.io.json.json_normalize()).\n4. Arrange the columns in the order given in the question. This will allow you to apply the logic to make sure that only columns explicitly present in the input prompt without hallucinating or using data not in the dataset.\n5. Split the input prompt into chunks using string.split().\n6. Further refine chunks into chunks containing numbers (using [0-9]\"\") and chunks containing letters [a-zA-Z]\".\n7. For boolean questions, generate appropriate queries:\n   - Check for chunks containing the desired output and, if present, compare those chunks with True or False and use [all] to check answer.\n8. For numerical questions, generate appropriate queries:\n   - Check if chunks contain keywords related to size, total, average, minimum, maximum, and sum.\n   - For the given chunks, use aggregate functions like [size, sum, count, mean] to generate appropriate queries.\n9. For category questions (List[Category] and Category), generate appropriate queries:\n   - Check for chunks containing keywords like most, common, frequent, least, secondary, along with any column names in the given prompt.\n   - For chunks containing keywords like \"name\", \"label\", \"value\", or when unique values are available within the column, output the unique values.\n   - Remaining chunks with only column names and calculate mode, count, sum, mean, or average using those columns for category entries.\n10. Finally, assign the answer type inferred from the question to an answer type variable and check if there are existing questions with the same answer but a different query. If yes, assess which response to send based on the Mongo id.\n11. Send the response to MongoDB.\n12. Make sure the response contains the proper answer type and the query response is acceptable.\n\nThe output response must contain the following information:\n{\n\"query_type\" : \"sum\", \n\"query_field\" : \"Age\", \n\"query\" : df[\"Age\"][df[\"Survived\"] == True].sum(),  # This must be on a single line\n\"query_result\" : 46\n}\n\n**Input Format**:\nA JSON object with the required and key details:\n- 1. dataset: JSON object for the dataset along with provided columns as keys and data types as their corresponding values.\n- 2. question: Input question text that the user has provided, containing the question an information query e.g. \u2018what is the most common type of gender among the shoppers?\u2019\n- 3. query_imitators: JSON objects for the existing set of questions and their responses.\n- 4. mongo_id: The Mongo id of the existing question e.g. \u2018bnsuifhsd78748d\u2019.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n# Importing the necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom collections import defaultdict\nimport json\n\n\n# Query generation function.\ndef generate_query(dataset, question, query_imitators, mongo_id):\n    # Load the JSON data into a pandas DataFrame.\n    df = pd.io.json.json_normalize(dataset)\n    # Arrange columns in alphabetical order.\n    df = df[sorted(df.columns)]\n    # Split the input question into chunks.\n    slices = question.split()\n    # List for storing chunks containing numbers\n    num_chunks = []\n    # List for storing chunks containing words\n    word_chunks = []\n    # Iterate through each chunk and append only chunks containing numbers\n    for x in slices:\n        if any(n.isdigit() for n in x):\n            num_chunks.append(x)\n        else:\n            word_chunks."

The test suite includes many false cases for classification where they indicate a 'non-case' would be Implicit Answer Type: list by POI #1: BOOLEAN or list for which MAPLE will clearly use the other independent variable. For instance POI #1 above \"What's the most common gender among the survivors?\" \nwould best be answered by Implicit Answer Type: Category, it says nothing about gender so this could be argued to be either Male or Female, hence MALE or FEMALE answer question category. \n\nNaiive methods might work, but they are inappropriate here as it should be implicit and not based on any bias. A good program would also be able to answer non-asked questions based on domain knowledge priorities, relevant information definition of terms, related fields/specialized sources depending upon focus fields and boosted inference of relevance (context/implications) so also areas for consideration. The logic is an area for development\"\n\n- \"Thank you for this problem set.  I've chosen a slightly different solution that may take the approach you intended but uses a similar function for each question type.  Instead of a single piecemeal function that takes the cols/dtypes of the df and returns the relevant question, I have a different function that returns the column name given a target answer type, then those columns are used to query the df and return an answer.  Then to determine what answer type the question being asked, I look to see if the question contains a \"count\" and if it includes \"male\" and if it includes the string \"fe\" to determine the answer type requested.\"\n\n\n# Updates to some of the un-usable input questions\nQuestion: \"How many boat passengers per adult survivor?\"\n\nExpected Output:\nThe dataset doesn't have passengers' age, so finding the relation per adult is significantly hard.

The good thing about regular expressions is that they are incredibly flexible. The bad thing is that they are inflexible, therefore complicated.\n\nOnce you've found the relevant details, it's a matter of selecting the correct code from the appropriate lists.\n\n\\begin{code}\nimport re\n\ndata_type_to_answer_type_dict = {\n    \"bool\": \"Boolean\",\n    \"uint8\": \"Number\",\n    \"(bool, unique_values: [False, True])\": \"Boolean\",\n    \"(object\": \"Category\",\n    \"(category\": \"Category\",\n    \"object, unique_values:\": \"Category\",\n    \"(bool, unique_values: [False, True]]\": \"Boolean\",\n    \"(float64\": \"Number\",\n    \"(int64\": \"Number\",\n    \"datetime64[ns\": \"Date\",\n    \"float64, unique_values:\": \"List[Number]\",\n    \"float64, unique_values:\": \"Number\",\n    \"uint8, unique_values:\": \"Number\",\n    \"(bool, unique_values:\": \"Boolean\",\n    \"(object, unique_values:\": \"Category\",\n    \"(category, unique_values:\": \"Category\",\n    \"object]:\": \"Category\",\n    \"(object, unique_values\": \"Category\",\n    \"(category, unique_values\": \"Category\",\n    \"DataFrame, shape\": \"Code\",\n    \"Dataframe shape\": \"Code\","

The query input side has to be obtained through a user input interface.\n\n- Use Rete algorithm to represent and evolve graph-based knowledge structure.\n- Design an input mechanism for a user-friedly configuration of macro actions and attributes.\n- Demonstrate how the AI program performs a given task by providing a minimal reproducible example in the associated github project.\nTo focus on the adaptability of your system you might e.g. consider the following design decisions:\n- Use an ontology with a generic structure to support several kinds of assets, but not all the features.\n- Use rule-based determination of the respective features the user may request.\n- Represent the resultgraph also as an ontology with a suitable format.\n\nExample 1:\n\nThe user issues the query: All cars (Year, Color, Size) ordered by Year (ascending) and sized m. The GOI graph is a directed graph with nodes and edges using the GDL format. The graph contains a year feature, a color feature, a size feature, a car ontology, and a rating relation. To address these requirements the following operations take place:\n\n- Starting from an empty ontology ie., containing no nodes or edges the query is translated into a list of desired node features, in this case (Year, Color, Size).\n- Then comes the creation of edges needed for the necessary features and ontologies.\n- After this, a sorting based on the years feature is established. This results in a new ontology with ordering by year and naming by car, color, and size.\n\nSolution:\n```\nfrom ontquery.rete.parser import Parser\np = Parser()\n\nbert_ontology, bert_network = p.parse_file('miserables.groovy')\nqe = QuestionEngine(bert_network, bert_ontology)\n\nq = u'all cars sorted ascending by year'\n\nqv = pt.parse(q)\nonto = qe.run_query(qv.qb, qv.isa_schema)\n\nkm_json = onto.to_knowledge_map(rule=False)\nkm = json.loads(km_json)\n\n\njson.dump(km, open('miserables_result.json', 'w'), indent=4)\nprint('Successful query')\n```\nExample 2:\n\nThe user issues the query: \"Find all footwork friends of persons who are female.\" The ontology contains nodes for the domain CardanoWorks, even though footwork friends are located in a different domain. Thus, the result is not trivially resolvable after transforming into a feature graph, so the GOI should contain reasoning rules to derive the resulting ontology.\n\nSolution:\n```\nq = u'all footwork friends of people with the size e.g. small'\n\nqv = pt.parse(q)\nrule_network = create_rete_network(bert_ontology, b"

For example, (bool, unique_values: [False, True]). This is provided to help you understand the data better and generate accurate queries instead of assuming values where needed.\n\nPossible Answer Types:\n1. Boolean: When the question expects a yes/no answer.\n2. Number: When the question seeks a numerical value (e.g., sum, average, count, maximum, minimum, etc.).\n3. List[Number]: When the question requires a list of numerical values (e.g., values in a column or results of a computation).\n4. List[Category]: When the question asks for a list of unique or filtered categorical values (e.g., names, labels, etc.).\n5. Category: When the question expects a single categorical value (e.g., most frequent category or specific label).\n\nResponse Requirements:\n- Only use columns explicitly provided in the input prompt.\n- Avoid hallucinating columns or using data not present in the dataset.\n- Always provide a single-line pandas query that outputs the answer based on the inferred type.\n- Ensure the query is concise, accurate, and directly maps to the inferred answer type.\n\nMake sure you are able to infer what answer type is required from the question provided and you can analyze which columns to use from total columns to answer the question. \n\n**Examples**:\n\nQuestion: \"What's the most common gender among the survivors?\" \n Dataset Columns: Survived (bool, unique_values: [False, True]), Pclass (uint8, unique_values: [3, 1, 2]), Name (object), Sex (category, unique_values: [male, female]), Age (float64), Siblings_Spouses Aboard (uint8, unique_values: [1, 0, 3, 4, 2, 5, 8]), Parents_Children Aboard (uint8, unique_values: [0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6]), Fare (float64)\n\nYou should provide the following code:\ndf[df['Survived'] == True]['Sex'].mode()[0]\n\nQuestion: \"How many passengers boarded without any siblings or spouses?\" \n Dataset Columns: Survived (bool, unique_values: [False, True]), Pclass (uint8, unique_values: [3, 1, 2]), Name (object), Sex (category, unique_values: [male, female]), Age (float64), Siblings_Spouses Aboard (uint8, unique_values: [1, 0, 3, 4, 2, 5, 8]), Parents_Children Aboard (uint8, unique_values: [0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6]), Fare (float64)\n\nYou should provide the following code: \ndf[df['Siblings_Spouses Aboard'] == 0].shape[0]\n",

This returns a compiled string query that can be run on the dataset.\n```python\nfrom QuestionQueries.DatasetGroupQuery import DatasetGroupQuery\nfrom QuestionQueries.QuestionQuery import dispatch_query_type\n\n## Backend endpoint\n@routes_bp.route(\"/vectorize_query\", methods=[\"POST\"])\ndef vectorize_input_query_post():\n    try:\n        json_data = request.get_json()\n        if json_data.get(\"input_question\"):\n            input_question = json_data[\"input_question\"]\n        elif json_data[\"query_string\"]:\n            input_query = json_data[\"query_string\"]\n        else:\n            raise KeyError(\"Key not found in json data\")\n\n        if json_data[\"dataset_col_info\"] != []:\n            dataset_state = json_data[\"dataset_col_info\"]\n        else:\n            raise ValueError(\"Dataset column information is missing\")\n\n        output = dispatch_query_type(input_question, dataset_state)\n        query_kind = output[0]\n        query_string = output[1]\n        if query_kind == \"fact\":\n            # Execute a single count query\n            query_results = pd.read_sql_query(query_string, eng)\n            # whatever report you want to make with query_results\n\n        elif query_kind == \"group\":  # aggregate group query\n            dataset_col_info = DatasetGroupQuery(dataset_state)\n            output = dataset_col_info.vectorize_query(output[1])\n            engine_r = get_engine_as(\"ResultsDB\", \"Results\")\n            query_results = pd.read_sql_query(output, engine_r)\n            # whatever report you want to make with query_results\n        # elif ... other query types\n\n        return query_string\n\n    except KeyError as e:\n        print(\n            'Error parsing JSON request.

This function tests whether input is of type 'fact', 'group' among other types.\n\nThis function modifies the input prompt in various manner to surround column names and values within quotes if not already. Additionally, it replaces Pandas syntax for Tag.column to be Tag['column'] since we want to focus more around vectorization and do not require flexible pandas querying.\n```python\nif is_fact_query(query_kind):\n    fact_query_object = FactQuery(input_question=graph_query)\n    vectorized_query, vectorized_column_details = fact_query_object.vectorize_query(\n        tags\n    )\n\nelif command == \"group\":\n    print(\"group command activated\")\n    group_query_object = GroupQuery(input_question=graph_query)\n    vectorized_query = group_query_object.vectorized_group_query(\n        tags,\n        focus_tags=focus_tags,\n        vector_unique_column=vector_unique_column,\n    )\n    # unique_column ="

All operations within this segment will be performed in a CSR-sorted manner. As it creates a view that can be sliced/sorted/iterated/etc, this method is very efficient, especially for large sets of data. There are many subtleties though. The fact that this method creates a 'view' might be bad if you make a lot of in-place operations...\nThe other (and more important) advantage of iloc is that it is memory-safe at the expanse of some performance: you cannot create such a view to a segment of data that does not exist. Meaning that you can't specify 10:14:100 with iloc, which you can with .loc.

Sharing struggle is a powerful tool for learning.\n- The more you know personally, the better you understand the messaging needs.\n- If you see layout problems in on-disk version, try the latest browser with latest version of our low-code-for-everyone lib. Latest version can have margins, borders, alignment just the way we like it. Problems should not propagate in a low-code environment, so if you see any, open an issue and paste a file export from Notebook. We'll add you to repo and invest time to retrieve latest browser.\n\n\n# JQuery\n\n\n\n## Learning JQuery\n\n  Jquery is a simple and fast javaScripting library which works with php javascript json aalother languages like ajax c# java python etc. it is used for easing and convenience of java script with reducing the complexity of whole code. Its like a library which consists of bunch of easy techniques. *Basically it is used for making backend side of websites, website with GUI are made increasing more and more. Android Applications are also created. Many other fields and fields are using this framework.*\n  \n  \n **Features of Jquery**\n1. directly works with selected element from DOM. directly interaction with HTML is this type of programming. \n2. all type of operations are done using methods which is good than java script.\n3. small in size so easy to datasets and support to browser and system compatible.\n4. widely used library worldwide. its useful for both professional and amateur.\n5. developers community is widening popularity of this framework\n6. need non technical expertise in both front end and back end.\n\n###### **Abstruct of JQuery**\n1. serialize\n data to pass to server from client browser\n2. Reduce the code length.\n3. faster execution of JavaScript.\n4. It contains many methods which uses **this**  which makes easier way to coding\n\n*i don't want to see repetition of code. *\n```javasciprt\n $('.box1').animate().animate().animate()  \n\n $('.box2').animate().animate().animate()\n $('.box3').animate().animate().animate()\n\n $('.box4').animate().animate().animate()\n```\n i am repeating this. it is total 4 times.\n```javasciprt\n $('.box').animate().animate().animate()\n```\nonly one i need to do.\n_note_ : the above source helps if we use java script frequently. but i am lucky to use jquery i dont need repetition of **$('.box').;**.\n"
