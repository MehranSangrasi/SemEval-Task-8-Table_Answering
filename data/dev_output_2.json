The organzisation entity is assigned an ID from 0 to their own entity length (for example \"Apple\" would be \"ORG\"). Map the entity ID from the text dataset to company_names dataset according to their ID. \n\nUse your own code and existing code that you received from Bridge Builders to solve the task. Keep in mind that while running models on large volumes of text data, it is important to save resources on the cloud infrastructure and reduce the computational pressure.\n\n**Task #2: Sample the company names**\n- Sampled companies by the rule: randomly sampling x% of companies visually (i.e.: roughly pooled 1M), with status (if it's existing or long-time existing) for further cleaning and preprocessing, other than long time existing.\n\nUse your own code and existing code that you received from Bridge Builders to solve the task.\n'''\n\n'''Results description:\n\n**Table results of Task 1: Company and Organization names in the training data**\n- The dataframe is created, also all the companies are merged in multiple column like \"organization.id\", \"companies\", \"companies.original\" and \"org_description\".\n- In the org_description column, we have taken text from the entity mention after named entity i.e e.g Apple eleven company.\n\nBelow Result need to be mentioned in response.\n1) Before getting the company name by NER, the database has a lot of company name already mentioned \n** Mentioned data: 9461 records\n\n2) After getting the company name, we need to further check it's NER status so decided to renew the mentioned company name with the ones from NER status\n** Updated Data: 7296 records\n\n3) Sorting the data based on unique ID's\nin[12]: data_company['companies'].nunique()\n\n4) Total count of records\nin[13]: data_company['id'].nunique()\n\n** Table results of Task 2: Sampled Companied Based on Statuss**\n- The dataframe is created using seaborn and pyplot function, so that we can draw the bar graph using this dataframe.  \n\nBelow Result need to be mentioned in response.\n1) Basically we have three types of companies, \n** Existing: 2404\nExisting.sort_values(by=['count'], ascending=False).index\n'intuitive', 'liftmaster', 'a1', 'a1comms', 'baringo'\n\n2) Long time existing: 1687\nExisting.sort_values(by=['count'], ascending=False).index\n'amazoneu', 'kellerkind'\n\n3) Sorting the data based on upper and lower bound\n```CSS\ndata_companies.sort_values(by=['count'], ascending=False)\n\nlower bound : int(len(data_companies['companies'].unique()) * 0.7) # Sample 70% companies\ndata_companies_sampled = data_companies['companies'][:lower_bound]\n\nExisting + existing long-time existing are combined 2404 + 1687 = 4101.\n4101 > 3712(Company already entered) + 400(Sampling data - existing)(from task-1 extracted new company name) = 4109"

In case of any Discussion Feedback, you can have multiple teams discuussing about each sample. So do take out some time to review their suggestions before finalizing your output submission. \n\nWe will start with a small dataset in the first round and gradually work with more sophisticated datasets in our subsequent rounds. We will work through this dataset to get over all possible scenarios and then generate our large simulations that in turn we would request from you. \n\nMost of all, have fun.

You can use all the libraries available.\n\n## Usage\n\nTo use this assistant, read the documentation of the pandas library (again, if you are not familiar), and interact with it providing a valid question and dataset to obtain a valid answer directly by DataFrame query.\nPlease, always provide a question when asked to, but these requirements only apply if you are using the included Jupyter Notebook.\nIf you don't, questions are expected at the prompt where the query is being constructed.\n\n*Assumption: The question will attempt to exploit the logic provided in these datasets only (i.e. fetching without using or analyzing purchased or synthetic data)*\n\n### Assisting via Jupyter Notebook\nOpen `assistant.ipynb` via Jupyter Notebook or another Jupyter Enviornment to assist with the generation. Depending on what is pre-provided with the current logic, it either:\n1. Asks for a column name first and analyze\u0432\u0430\u0435\u0442 the logic based on information, or\n2. Takes pre-provided information and automatically logs the elaboration process and provides an answer.\n\n![png](\"output.png\"])\n\n### Assisting via Console\nTo test the assistant for a question, run `assistant.py` file with the given dataset provided in the input. As valid or unreasonable input is given; the assistant will either assist you in finding the appropriate query (answer DNS resolution) or exclaim an ambiguous input (answer not found) *(HTML encoded for printing)*.\n\n## List of answers\n\nFor now, the list of questions, acceptable:\n\n1. What is the sum of all passenger's ages in the dataset?\n2. How many women passengers are afforded the 1st class with the lowest or online average fare?\n3. What is the most common `embarked` point in the dataset for men or groups of men?\n4. How many suicide attempts (judging by the `query` argument) has the author with the most followers?\n5. Top 2 male or female authors with the most Twitter connections.\n6. What is the average `query` argument for male or female authors from New York?\n7. What is the list of names or `hashtags` recommended for the top 3 most followers or the most number of tweets per account in the dataset?\n8. Who is the author with the most tweets per account in the dataset with a certain hashtag?\n9. What is the list of authors or users featured in the benchmark work? \n10. Who is the head of the house on a bus ride to work with the highest number of award or the highest-ranking followers in 10 years of followers based on information from the provided dataset \"tweets_dataset.parquet\"?\n11. What are the top 2 corporate brands or most followers that an author has earned over the past 10 years under research?\n12. What is the average number of mentions or tweets that an author has gotten?\n13. What about the average number of retweets, favorites or link sharing of each tweet written?\n14. Is there an average number of previous home locations have changed at most?\n15. How about the average delay between different replied to us?\n16. Is there any average delay between different replied to us with transitive or synchronous connotation between them (e.g., to watch the sun rise or dancing in the inferno)?\n17. How about the average hour of the day?\n18. Does the average hour of weekly delay vary depending on the target followed (e.g., Twitter page for celebrities or respected news sources)?\n19. How about the `source` of the most viewed or the most equiped authors based on followers on the research?\n20. Is there a single data connection for the author with the most number of followers (e.g., tumblr, tweetbot, twitter application download"

Use the **SimpleTokenizer** class for this.\n  - Remove the stopwords and punctuation, convert the words to their numerical representations, and convert the numerical representations to numerical representations. Use the **SimpleTokenizer** class for this. \n  - Split a question based on punctuations and other stopwords i.e. \"which\" , \"that\", \"is\", \"of\", \"has\", etc. \n  - Generate an embedding of each question words \n  - Use of Embeddings:  Here you are getting a vector of the embeddings of each question words.

Note that you should be in project root to import correctly.\n```python\nfrom question_answering_data_explorer.data.Question import Question as Q\nfrom question_answering_data_explorer.data.Answer import Answer as A\nfrom question_answering_data_explorer.data.database import Dataset\n\n# this can be local folder or a url\ndatabase_path = 'example_data/germany_2020_cities.csv'\n\n# importers are in charge of opening files\nimporter = CsvImporter(\"database/data-set-survey-position.csv\") \n\n# dataset takes in importer and reads all data to store\ndataset = Dataset(importer)\ndf = dataset.df #current df\n\nq = Q(\"What is the total number of murders in gang or organised crime types in Germany since 1980?\", [\"Crime\"]*14)\nanswer = q.answer_query(df)\n\nassert answer.value == float(105892)\n```\n\nThe Question-Answering Data Explorer is based around objects for which a question can be asked. The infrastructure around questions is slowly being built. For now, we supply all of the useful utilities within those objects. \n\n- A **Question** object requires a question and a list of column names to work with. It is the source of questions and suppliers of processors and outputters.\n```q=Q(\"What is the total number of murders in gang or organised crime types in Germany since 1980?\", [\"Crime\"]*8)```\n\n- A **Answer** object is the output of a **Processor**. It is a serializable data object and carries the answer and corresponding statistics.\n```answer=q.answer_query(df)```\n\n- A **Database** object simplifies loading of data into _pandas_ data frames. We just use urls and paths, so the data scientists interacting with the exporer do not need to know _pandas_ in detail.\n```database = Dataset(\"https://...csv\")```\n\nBut the development plan is to use zen architecture and to create actual subprocesses and subprocesses. Currently these sup modules are scattered throughout the package and their behaviour is very mixed.

Each yml file should contain, at minimum, the following two elements:\n\n\n1. `columns`: A list of the tables columns\n2. `questions`: A list of questions with unique `id` and required properties `q`, `a`, if the answer is a number, `unit`, `col` column name, if the answer should be a list, `col` is the first column name, and `col2` for the second column name.\n\n\n## Extensions of 1.0.0\n\n\nThere are 2 recognizable categories of configuration. One, nested transformations and grouping, and the second, isolating a column of a given type. \n\n\nThe [detailed documentation](#what-is-a-link-card) covers the various [link cards](#link-cards) and the the creation of them.\n\n\nDownload [an example configuration **yaml** file](https://www.kaggle.com/c/pitcher-and-unsupervised/data).\n\n\n\n<a id='extensions-of-1.0.0'></a>\n\n## Extensions of 1.0.0\n\nIn your configuration [yaml](#config-yml) you must also specify a `linkCard` object, which describes how a question will be answered and what properties or transformations are allowed. Some configs are `noLinkCard`, `countOnly`, `add`, `aggregate`, `filter`, and `acquire`.  \n\n\n<a id='link-cards'></a>\n\n### Link Cards\n\nAs explained in the [definitions](#definitions) section, a linkCard is a Python dictionary holding the data needed to transform incoming data to the answer. Each card has `type` in `[collect, convertBetweenRawDataAndAnswerSpace]`.\n\n\nThe following three linkCards conceptually involve combining data from different column(s). They are not unlinked to standard answers (`answer`). They are however unlinked to Pandas queries, which are answered via  Python interpolation.\n\n\n1. [Cross](#link-2-cross-join)\n2.

Firstly we need to preprocess the data. In input questions mentioned column names, but they are mentioned in the string form.\nFor instance, if questions looks like \"What is the average income of gender womam\". Then initial code will be:\n`predict('What is the average income of gender Balck')\nBut then the first step will be to extract gner from string and convert it to their legitimate names from initial dataset.\n\n2. So from input questions we need to extract **Columns** names which are proposed for output. **This step is important because different columns can add very different numbers**\nWas for instance data looks like Vidora vs. Gunhill; Bliss bei Flyinge, and we try to extract somehws from first data \nBut this data contains time lapses. Then when we want to check which data is less or bigger it has no sense.\n\n3. Based on the step one, we should to extract in which order they **Columns** were mentioned in the input question. Because in this case should to insert na into **Columns**  different from first and second place\n\n4. Standardize the input question by removing punctuation and special symbols using sub function\n5. Analyze the input question and its required type (boolean, number, list[number] and etc.)\n6. Based on the step 5 with the help of step 2 extract whether the reported question requires any calculations to solve. For instance, if question sounds like \"What company in how many rows\"\nThen the requirement is to calculate sum of rows. \nTotal of rows problem is relatively easier, because we iterate only through the DataFrame columns\n**So important thing is to extraction, preparation of needed statistics and calculation**\n\n7. With a standard method proposed into pandas we ensure the column names independence \n\n\nLinke is predicted spark solution\nLink to medium post:\n\n```\n[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66886704/153738842-c09dc974-4a85-4c3f-b017-467e4fab7284.png)](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/unleash-power-of-your-data-using-pynex-github-nldi3hi7g7/details)\n```\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/900/1*pnNGVU8cv4G5SjHlKiFIrg.png)\n\nOverall complexity of solution is corresponds with medium gravitating dimension of problem. \n\ntasks that was mentioned:\n1. to check the request consistans tho the provided datatypes of columns\n2. to cpay attention on case sensitivity\n3. to provide the information about clearly that sometimes response can contain NaNs because of input format of columns\n4. gan simplify/compress existing solution\n\nRandom ideas how to work with it:"

Autopilot should accomplish the below. \n\n1. Going forward\n2. Avoid obstacles on the road\n3. Keep same distance between the car and the next one on the road\n4. Follow traffic rules (keep to the right side of the road when side road is on right and left on the left side)\n\n\nYou should implement this autopilot on your own. Following are the inputs and outputs of the Autopilot program, take a look at the image below for reference\n- Inputs:\n-- Forward speed = Speed the car should move at, from 0.0 cm/s to 99.0 cm/s.\n-- Lookahead distance = The maximum distance (m) to look for any other vehicles.\n-- Clearance = The minimum distance (m) that should be maintained between the car and any other vehicles.\n-- Preferred speed = Desired speed the autopilot should try to achieve.\n-- Next vehicles positions.\n- Output:\n-- Desired speed related to the car.\n-- Restrictions to make optimally safe turns and during emergencies.\n-- Desired rest position to impact the brakes.\n\n\n##- You are given a **car struct**.\nStruct car {\n  double speed;\n  double lookahead_distance;\n  double clearance;\n  double preferred_speed;\n  std::vector<double> current_vehicle_distances;\n};\n\n##- Output\nstruct control_action {\n  double desired_speed;\n  bool turn_left;\n  bool brake;\n  bool turn_right;\n};\n\n### Sample output:\n\n\n\nNavigation rules. It is very important to follow these rules, if you don't, your program will very likely crash!\n\nIf speed is less than or equal to zero or greater than 99.0, or dist is less than or equal to zero or greater than 99.0, your answer is undefined or out of scope.\n\nTherefore, first make sure both the values are proper, only then you can start working.\n\nHere's a fragment in code on how you can get the value transformed to the range proper:\n\n- If speed > 99.0 then speed = 99.0\n- If speed < 0.0 then speed = 0.0\n- If dist[i] > 99.0 then dist[i] = 99.0\n- If dist[i] < 0.0 then dist[i] = 0.0\n\t\t\n\n### Required output\nYou should provide the desired speed which is related to car. If there is no safe/optimized speed (when a lane change is required to avoid crash), informed observation of the environment is also required, and we describe three possible actions and hard stop should be considered:\n\n- If you don't see any vehicle ahead in the lookahead distance, it is safe to drive at your preferred speed.\n- If there are obstacles ahead of you, you need to drive at your safe speed which is lower than your preferred speed.\n\nTwo ways for Safe obstacle avoidance:\n1. Create two np arrays, 1st contains values of forward speed up to 99.9(or maximum speed), and 2nd contains values of dist(or distance for which obstacle is appearing)for the purpose of lookahead distance. values in dist are from original array.\n2. Store weight  against each Value of distance in a dictionary \n3. then apply inter-polation(perhaps between linear and cosine) to get speed for a lookahead distance.\n\nNow you need to calculate the clearance. Make two-dimensional array of \n   clearance, see an example given below.\n\n\n```\n(Look at the way you solve the given problem here. ) Size will be (N x 1) dimensional, where N is number of vehicles in the picture.)\n```\n\n**Example code  Gridlock :**\n```\nInput : clearance[i] = 3.0 : Look ahead distance = 2.0 \n\n Output:\n                               "

To build models, we need machine translation datasets. Now, as an ML engineer you need to identify the common languages in the dataset, which you can achieve by getting the subset of languages in the training dataset which cover at least 0.01% of the training data. But you don't know how to extract languages correctly from the problem critical feature language.\n\nIn this project, we will help you in identifying the unique languages correctly. You need to write a python script that:\n\n* Reads a csv file from a given path (Sample csv dataset is also given along with this project).\n* Extracts the language feature from the csv file.\n* Outputs all unique languages from the language feature of csv file.\n* you can also sort languages based on their number of occurence by writing a secondary funciton.\n\nYou will find multiple python files in this project containing the base code for this project. You only need to focus on `src` folder containing various python files and edit these files with your code. You will find datasets in the `resource` folder which could be useful to test,tetraining and to inference.\n\n### Evaluation Metric\n` hillvalley-problem` will evaluate your code based on below parameters:\n\n* 50 penalty points if your code does not compile and run on macOS and Linux environments\n* 500 points deduction if your submission fails on any of the test cases.\n* 100 points if you produce more languages (outputs) than expected.\n* 50 points if your submission produces all the languages, but includes further languages not necessary\n* 0 points if you satisfy all the requirements successfully. \n\n\n\n### How to Test:\n\nAfter you have placed your code in all the python files. Please run `hillvalley-problem` directory by running below command:\n```\npython app.py\n```\nAbove commad will run a `main` function from `app.py` file which will run all the tests.\n\n\n\n### Submitting your code:\n\n\nPlease submit all the python files in `src` along with your submission file.\n"

Please complete query generation inside these functions.\n\n**You should never write any code outside the three reusable functions since we're going to re-use the same code across different tests**\n\nThe order in which the function API is called is based on the order used in the for loop below in the `query` function.\n- For a 1-step question: only the 1st function will be called.\n- For a 2-step question: 1st and 2nd function will be called.\n- For a 3-step question: all three functions will be called.\n\nThe order in which functions are called for Q-A is based on current problem statement. In future we may go for a different order if needed as long as the function API defined above are compatible with our Q-A.\n\nUse functions like `first_selection`, `second_selection`, `third_selection`, etc. to compose a complete query returning a single string value. Make sure you include return statements accordingly.\n\nIn case any parameters are required for the selection functions, these can be passed on as a list of arguments at the end of each functions. \n\nExample: \n```\ndef first_selection(df):\n    return df['destination'].str.contains('Home')\n```"

This is provided to help you understand the data better and generate accurate queries instead of assuming values where needed.\n\nPossible Answer Types:\n1. Boolean: When the question expects a yes/no answer.\n2. Number: When the question seeks a numerical value (e.g., sum, average, count, maximum, minimum, etc.).\n3. List[Number]: When the question requires a list of numerical values (e.g., values in a column or results of a computation).\n4. List[Category]: When the question asks for a list of unique or filtered categorical values (e.g., names, labels, etc.).\n5. Category: When the question expects a single categorical value (e.g., most frequent category or specific label).\n\nResponse Requirements:\n- Only use columns explicitly provided in the input prompt.\n- Avoid hallucinating columns or using data not present in the dataset.\n- Always provide a single-line pandas query that outputs the answer based on the inferred type.\n- Ensure the query is concise, accurate, and directly maps to the inferred answer type.\n\nMake sure you are able to infer what answer type is required from the question provided and you can analyze which columns to use from total columns to answer the question. \n\n**Examples**:\n\nQuestion: \"What's the most common gender among the survivors?\" \n Dataset Columns: Survived (bool, unique_values: [False, True]), Pclass (uint8, unique_values: [3, 1, 2]), Name (object), Sex (category, unique_values: [male, female]), Age (float64), Siblings_Spouses Aboard (uint8, unique_values: [1, 0, 3, 4, 2, 5, 8]), Parents_Children Aboard (uint8, unique_values: [0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6]), Fare (float64)\n\nYou should provide the following code:\ndf[df['Survived'] == True]['Sex'].mode()[0]\n\nQuestion: \"How many passengers boarded without any siblings or spouses?\" \n Dataset Columns: Survived (bool, unique_values: [False, True]), Pclass (uint8, unique_values: [3, 1, 2]), Name (object), Sex (category, unique_values: [male, female]), Age (float64), Siblings_Spouses Aboard (uint8, unique_values: [1, 0, 3, 4, 2, 5, 8]), Parents_Children Aboard (uint8, unique_values: [0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6]), Fare (float64)\n\nYou should provide the following code: \ndf[df['Siblings_Spouses Aboard'] == 0].shape[0]\n",

        "output": "), approval (float64), mention_count (uint32)\n\nYou should provide the following code:\ndf['author_name'].mode()[0]\n\n**Key takeaways**:\n1. **Read the question critically**: Since the objective is to provide the answers by the use of pandas DataFrame queries, the question analysed should be appropriate for selecting specific columns, merging tables, filtering, sorting, and grouping.\n\n2. ** Understand the columns**: Each column is provided with their data type, and in some cases, a unique set of values. Knowing these details can help you optimize the code, choose appropriate pandas methods, and accurately answer the questions.\n\n3. **Answer Type**: Remember the answer types - Boolean, Number, List[Number], List[Category], and Category. Not all questions require a category or list of some category, and sometimes, you can use numerical answers instead.\n\n4.  Analysis should be accurate:  ALL columns should be used and reference to them explicitly.\n\n## Instructions\n\nInstall the required libraries and dependencies:\n```python\n!pip install -r requirements.txt -qqq\nimport pandas, numpy, requests, io, time, datetime, dateutil, pytz, gzip\nassets = io.BytesIO(requests.get('https://s21.q2cdn.com/761488/latest/en_US/questions_cohort%20df%20%2B%20answer%20memoize.ipynb.gz', headers={'Referer': 'https://q2.ai'}).content)\nassets = gzip.open(assets)\n```\nRun the tests using pytest `pytest .` in the terminal to check if your code is right\n\n## Screenshot of sample output\n---\n![Output](screenshot.png)\n"

In `common counting` conditions, it checks whether the question contains any `in, most, least` etc keyword, If match, it performs compare with `KNOWN_KEYWORDS`, If not match with any, Then it means ` question type stores common counting`. \n3. Then, Second conditions will checks for the infinity symbol, Exclamation Marks (``!``) and  quote marks (```'```), then if found any of that symbol, it will return error message. \n4. then, ``pandas Series Boolean Condition`` takes the series data, data type and both conditions, if the Datatype stores boolean (``bool``) then it perform boolean query `df['column'].is(/not)null()` then will return the query, `data type is float cannot perform .isnull() operation`, otherwise if not matches, it means the datatype stores any other, then perform null checking query `spk['Sex'].isnull(np.nan for true/false)`\n```python\n####### Number Questions ########\nif q_type in ['number', 'float number']:\n    if 'Category Question' in q_type:\n        spk = df[['id', 'name', \"level\"]].copy()\n        if (re.search('count', question)):\n            spk = df['level'].copy()\n        elif(re.search('least|lowest|minimum|smallest', question)):\n            spk = spk[spk['level'].isin([min(spk['level'])])].copy()\n        elif (re.search('most|greatest|maximum|largest', question)):\n            spk = spk[spk['level'].isin([max(spk['level'])])].copy()\n        else:\n            spk = spk[spk['level'].isin(list(df['level'].unique()))].copy()\n        dtype = 'float'\n    else:\n        if 'AND' in question:\n            mask = list(map(\n                lambda x: re.sub(\n                    '[\\(\\)\\.\\+\\*]', '', x.split('has')[0].split()[-1]) == 'NULL', \n                re.findall(r'((?!or)has [\\w\\.\\\\\\/\\+\\-\\_]+)',question)))\n            question = re.sub(\n            r'((?!or)has [\\w\\.\\\\\\/\\+\\-\\_]+)', \n            'Previous', \n            question)\n            df = df.loc[~df[column[0]].isin([np.nan for b in mask])].copy()\n            question = re.sub(\n                r'((?!or)Previous',"
