Generate a single-line pandas DataFrame query that extracts the required answer directly from the dataset.\n\nPossible Answer Types:\n1. Boolean: When the question expects a yes/no answer.\n2.

List[Category]: When the question asks for a list of unique or filtered categorical values (e.g., names, labels, etc.).\n5. Category: When the question expects a single categorical value (e.g., most frequent category or specific label).\n\nResponse Requirements:\n- Only use columns explicitly provided in the input prompt.\n- Avoid hallucinating columns or using data not present in the dataset.\n- Always provide a single-line pandas query that outputs the answer based on the inferred type.\n- Ensure the query is concise, accurate, and directly maps to the inferred answer type.\n\nIf the question or column names are ambiguous, ask for clarification.

Number: When the question seeks a numerical value (e.g., sum, average, count, maximum, minimum, etc.).\n3. List[Number]: When the question requires a list of numerical values (e.g., values in a column or results of a computation).\n4. List[Category]: When the question asks for a list of unique or filtered categorical values (e.g., names, labels, etc.).\n5. Category: When the question expects a single categorical value (e.g., most frequent category or specific label).\n\nResponse Requirements:\n- Only use columns explicitly provided in the input prompt.\n- Avoid hallucinating columns or using data not present in the dataset.\n- Always provide a single-line pandas query that outputs the answer based on the inferred type.\n- Ensure the query is concise, accurate, and directly maps to the inferred answer type.\n\nIf the question or column names are ambiguous, ask for clarification.

Number: When the question seeks a numerical value (e.g., sum, average, count, maximum, minimum, etc.).\n3. List[Number]: When the question requires a list of numerical values (e.g., values in a column or results of a computation).\n4. List[Category]: When the question asks for a list of unique or filtered categorical values (e.g., names, labels, etc.).\n5. Category: When the question expects a single categorical value (e.g., most frequent category or specific label).\n\nResponse Requirements:\n- Only use columns explicitly provided in the input prompt.\n- Avoid hallucinating columns or using data not present in the dataset.\n- Always provide a single-line pandas query that outputs the answer based on the inferred type.\n- Ensure the query is concise, accurate, and directly maps to the inferred answer type.\n\nIf the question or column names are ambiguous, ask for clarification.

List[Number]: When the question requires a list of numerical values (e.g., values in a column or results of a computation).\n4. List[Category]: When the question asks for a list of unique or filtered categorical values (e.g., names, labels, etc.).\n5. Category: When the question expects a single categorical value (e.g., most frequent category or specific label).\n\nResponse Requirements:\n- Only use columns explicitly provided in the input prompt.\n- Avoid hallucinating columns or using data not present in the dataset.\n- Always provide a single-line pandas query that outputs the answer based on the inferred type.\n- Ensure the query is concise, accurate, and directly maps to the inferred answer type.\n\nIf the question or column names are ambiguous, ask for clarification.

Number: When the question seeks a numerical value (e.g., sum, average, count, maximum, minimum, etc.).\n3. List[Number]: When the question requires a list of numerical values (e.g., values in a column or results of a computation).\n4. List[Category]: When the question asks for a list of unique or filtered categorical values (e.g., names, labels, etc.).\n5. Category: When the question expects a single categorical value (e.g., most frequent category or specific label).\n\nResponse Requirements:\n- Only use columns explicitly provided in the input prompt.\n- Avoid hallucinating columns or using data not present in the dataset.\n- Always provide a single-line pandas query that outputs the answer based on the inferred type.\n- Ensure the query is concise, accurate, and directly maps to the inferred answer type.\n\nIf the question or column names are ambiguous, ask for clarification.

List[Number]: When the question requires a list of numerical values (e.g., values in a column or results of a computation).\n4. List[Category]: When the question asks for a list of unique or filtered categorical values (e.g., names, labels, etc.).\n5. Category: When the question expects a single categorical value (e.g., most frequent category or specific label).\n\nResponse Requirements:\n- Only use columns explicitly provided in the input prompt.\n- Avoid hallucinating columns or using data not present in the dataset.\n- Always provide a single-line pandas query that outputs the answer based on the inferred type.\n- Ensure the query is concise, accurate, and directly maps to the inferred answer type.\n\nIf the question or column names are ambiguous, ask for clarification.

List[Category]: When the question asks for a list of unique or filtered categorical values (e.g., names, labels, etc.).\n5. Category: When the question expects a single categorical value (e.g., most frequent category or specific label).\n\nResponse Requirements:\n- Only use columns explicitly provided in the input prompt.\n- Avoid hallucinating columns or using data not present in the dataset.\n- Always provide a single-line pandas query that outputs the answer based on the inferred type.\n- Ensure the query is concise, accurate, and directly maps to the inferred answer type.\n\nIf the question or column names are ambiguous, ask for clarification.

List[Category]: When the question asks for a list of unique or filtered categorical values (e.g., names, labels, etc.).\n5. Category: When the question expects a single categorical value (e.g., most frequent category or specific label).\n\nResponse Requirements:\n- Only use columns explicitly provided in the input prompt.\n- Avoid hallucinating columns or using data not present in the dataset.\n- Always provide a single-line pandas query that outputs the answer based on the inferred type.\n- Ensure the query is concise, accurate, and directly maps to the inferred answer type.\n\nIf the question or column names are ambiguous, ask for clarification.
